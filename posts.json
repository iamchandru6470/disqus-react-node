    "content": "Everyone who used early telecommunications services, not to mention the early dial-up Internet services, is familiar with the tones and hissing sounds of a modem establishing a connection. I recall all my home computer modems, from the early 1980s 300 baud units through to the late 1990s 56K units all having speakers to provide this audible status/feedback during dialing and connecting. Indeed, it is one of the strongest memories surrounding telecommunications during those years.",
